# Introducing MailHaven: A smarter way to track, manage and receive packages

New kicks, new tablet, the hottest clothes, and that one thing you’ve been drooling over for the past six months — you order it all online and expect it to arrive on time in perfect condition, but we all know that doesn’t always happen. “Sorry we missed you!” feels more hollow every time you read it. Searching through your email to call the courier gets old. With MailHaven you can shop worry free online, get a better experience between checkout to when you package arrives and know every package will arrive safe ‘n sound, right at home

## What is MailHaven?

We are a startup dedicated to solving an archaic and lackluster experience of the last segment of online shopping by providing accountability, security and convenience for our customers. MailHaven is a two phase solution that will change how we shop and usher in a smarter way to organize, track and receive packages.
