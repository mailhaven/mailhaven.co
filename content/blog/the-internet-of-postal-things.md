# The Internet of Postal Things

It’s the day after Prime Day and there is a strong likelihood that over $1 billion was spent by online consumers. Now the wait begins, couriers are scrambling to get the items you ordered to your front door. A process that requires new innovation and still has some outdated practices, like the challenge of tracking packages real-time. Some packages would arrive the day they are supposed, but close to 20% would have to be taken back for re-delivery.

Inability to track and the high re-delivery rates cost consumers time, frustration, and money. However, the problem is even larger for couriers and has spawned a new industry — the Internet of Postal Things (IoPT). Before I delve further into the IoPT, it’s worthwhile to mention the industrial revolutions: the first included such innovations like steamboat, water, mechanical production equipment; the second was division of labor, electricity, mass production; and the third which we are more familiar with, is the computer, electronics and the internet. However innovation rarely halts, we are now ushering in the 4th industrial revolution which entails a world where billions of devices are connected to the internet, where man and machine become highly interconnected.
