#Preorders

Thanks to every one for their support over the last few months, we announced that we won a $25,000 grant through the Vogt Innovations awards in September. In addition, we recently won the Greater Louisville Inc, Hot & Fast Innovation Award. We were selected among the 6 startups recognized as innovative early stage startups for the Hot Fast Innovation Awards in Louisville, KY. You can read more about it here.

We also recently got awarded a $75,000 grant from the Nucleus Innovation Center & Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. This has allowed us to get an additional office space and increase our engineering team. We are now located in the Nucleus Innovation Center, in addition to being incubated by Forest Giant.
