# Vogt Awards Winners


We are glad to announce that we are one of the six Vogt Awards winners. This is an award for startups with high potential to create technology that can scale, provide immense value and increase economic activity in the Louisville Metropolitan area.

Since 1999, the Vogt Awards program has been funding product development and commercialization of ideas for founders from across the United States. The Awards are made possible by the Vogt Invention and Innovation Fund which is managed by the Community Foundation of Louisville with programming managed by GLIâ€™s EnterpriseCorp. - [Vogtawards](http://www.vogtawards.com/)


I and Mailhaven co-founder Jonathan are very grateful for this opportunity, as we were both recipients of local scholarships that helped us get our college education and now our startup is supported by the local community. Jonathan, in particular was a recipient of the Vogt scholar award in high school which allowed him to attend Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he is now a recipient of the Vogt awards for innovation with Mailhaven.


As winners, we will receive $25,000 in undiluted funding and 12- weeks of mentorship through the Vogt awards program with well respected leaders in the business and technology community. In addition to the benefits of the cash award, we are very excited to work with the mentors and hope to achieve the milestones we have set for ourselves.


We are working on the 3rd iteration of our fully functional prototype which will be available for preorder next month and we will deliver to customers in late November. If you would like to get in queue to preorder or just follow our progress [sign-up for updates.](/#formsection)
