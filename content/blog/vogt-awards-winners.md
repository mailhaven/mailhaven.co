# Vogt Awards Winners

We are glad to announce that we are one of the six Vogt Awards winners. This is an award for startups with high potential to create technology that can scale, provide immense value and increase economic activity in the Louisville Metropolitan area.

Since 1999, the Vogt Awards program has been funding product development and commercialization of ideas for founders from across the United States. The Awards are made possible by the Vogt Invention and Innovation Fund which is managed by the Community Foundation of Louisville with programming managed by GLIâ€™s EnterpriseCorp. - [Vogtawards](http://www.vogtawards.com/)

I and Mailhaven co-founder Jonathan are very grateful for this opportunity, as we were both recipients of local scholarships that helped us get our college education and now our startup is supported by the local community. Jonathan, in particular was a recipient of the Vogt scholar award in high school which allowed him to attend Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he is now a recipient of the Vogt awards for innovation with Mailhaven.
