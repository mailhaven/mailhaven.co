## In The News

Along with the increased occurrences are increased reports of package theft, porch pirates have been very cavalier in their operations knowing their success rate is high and the probability they get caught is very low. Packages just sitting in plain sight are not only an easy target for miscreants but also present an opportunity crime that might tempt a person who initially had no intention of swiping a package. Here are some reports of package theft around the country.

[Sacramento](http://fox40.com/2016/01/22/thief-returns-stolen-package-with-note-sorry-for-the-inconvenience/), a Fair Oaks resident had his package stolen, however there was a fortunate twist for the victim. The thief returned the package to the owner after noticing it was meant for a child and also left a note apologizing for his criminal act.

[Florida](http://www.fox35orlando.com/news/local-news/56472059-story), In the Apopka neighborhood, a lady noticed packages she ordered were not in front of her home after they had been listed as delivered. She went ahead to check her surveillance camera only and noticed that a man drove an impala into her lot, took the first package and came back for the remaining two. Now that’s not giving a damn of any repercussion.

[Houston](http://www.click2houston.com/news/package-containing-item-worth-40000-stolen-from-doorstep), a North Harris County family had packages stolen from them and one of the stolen packages was worth $40,000. It was a item shipped to her resident by her work/company. The porch pirates in this case where on sort of a spree, they had driven behind the UPS truck stalking it and going after packages after they had been left in front of porches. A sad and brazen showing of the confidence by the thieves because of a broken system of package reception.

Customers have little or no convenient options when it comes to safeguarding their packages, some; have to free up their entire schedule on the day they are expecting a delivery, ship the delivery to a courier depot that they have to pay for the service in some cases and drive to go pick it up. Others use cameras and surveillance systems to try to protect their packages, even some vendors like ring have suggested it as a prevention method. However this is not a real deterrent and most porch pirates disregard the presence of a camera or just cover up their faces. A good analogy can be seen in the video below.
