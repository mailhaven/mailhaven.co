# What To Do If Your Package is Stolen

If you are one of the [23 million](https://medium.com/@Kela/the-rise-of-porch-pirates-da9629f01b43) Americans that have had their packages stolen at some point, you already know the frustration and confusion when this happens. As prevalent as this is, there are no real solutions to curb this and most people do not know what to do if they ever become a victim of package theft. Porch pirates are becoming smarter and targeting high income neighborhoods where couriers are accustomed to leaving the packages on the porches.

It usually works this way; couriers are not able to give the delivery to the recipient because they are absent and so they leave the package sitting on the porch, unsecured, hoping it will still be there whenever the recipients returns. Miscreants who were either trailing the couriers truck or have been driving around looking for packages then strike once no one is in sight. The recipient comes home, finds no package, checks the status online and it says it has been delivered, this is when all the confusion begins. Package theft is a problem we are trying to prevent and solve at my startup mailhaven, with our smart mailbox. Until then here are some things do if you ever have your package stolen, we hope you never have to use these instructions.
