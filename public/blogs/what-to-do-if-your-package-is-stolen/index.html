<h1 id="what-to-do-if-your-package-is-stolen">What To Do If Your Package is Stolen</h1>

<p>If you are one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@Kela/the-rise-of-porch-pirates-da9629f01b43">23 million</a> Americans that have had their packages stolen at some point, you already know the frustration and confusion when this happens. As prevalent as this is, there are no real solutions to curb this and most people do not know what to do if they ever become a victim of package theft. Porch pirates are becoming smarter and targeting high income neighborhoods where couriers are accustomed to leaving the packages on the porches.</p>

<p>It usually works this way; couriers are not able to give the delivery to the recipient because they are absent and so they leave the package sitting on the porch, unsecured, hoping it will still be there whenever the recipients returns. Miscreants who were either trailing the couriers truck or have been driving around looking for packages then strike once no one is in sight. The recipient comes home, finds no package, checks the status online and it says it has been delivered, this is when all the confusion begins. Package theft is a problem we are trying to prevent and solve at my startup mailhaven, with our smart mailbox. Until then here are some things do if you ever have your package stolen, we hope you never have to use these instructions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Check with your neighbors, roommates or anyone in your household who could have signed and received for your package on your behalf.</li>
<li>If you find out no one signed for it and it is indeed missing, call the police and make a report. You want to have yourself covered and have a report for the couriers and retailer/shipper. If there are any cameras installed around your home, try to get access to the footage and review it for any clues.</li>
<li>File a missing package claim with the courier; USPS, UPS, FEDEX</li>
<li>Contact the sender and ask them to follow up, file a complaint as well, this is usually the best option because they are the ones who hired the courier to perform the delivery. If any evidence is needed you have already filed a stolen report with the police that they can refer to.</li>
<li>Wait a couple days and maintain communications with the sender until they get it solved</li>
</ul>

<p>In almost all cases if the package was sent by a retailer like amazon or target, they will go ahead to replace your package for you and have another one sent out. However if this was sent by a friend or individual it is a bit tricky, it might be impossible to get the original package or replace it. Couriers usually insure shipped goods up to $100 and if it has a value over that amount, the shipper should have declared the value and insured the package. In this case the can work with the insurance company to reimburse them or you for the value of the package.</p>
