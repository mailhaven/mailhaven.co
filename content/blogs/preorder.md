# Preorders

Thanks to every one for their support over the last few months, we announced that we won a $25,000 grant through the Vogt Innovations awards in September. In addition, we recently won the Greater Louisville Inc, Hot & Fast Innovation Award. We were selected among the 6 startups recognized as innovative early stage startups for the Hot Fast Innovation Awards in Louisville, KY. You can read more about it [here](http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2016/09/26/hot-and-fast-enterprisecorp-names-louisvilles-most.html?ana=RSS%26s%3Darticle_search&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+bizj_louisville+%28Business+First+of+Louisville%29).

We also recently got awarded a $75,000 grant from the Nucleus Innovation Center & Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. This has allowed us to get an additional office space and increase our engineering team. We are now located in the Nucleus Innovation Center, in addition to being incubated by Forest Giant.

# PRE ORDERS ARE OPEN

We will be running a 20 unit pilot in late November to test out the new full functional mailhaven V.3 Prototypes and now accepting pre orders for the units. The amount of spots are limited we have not choice but to be selective. Below is a list of our selection criteria:
	•	Shop online and receives over 5 packages a month
	•	Live in a house with lawn space to mount the Mailhaven
	•	Willing to test the device and give feedback on the device use
	•	Understanding that the Mailhaven prototype may not work 100% of the time.
	•	Willing to purchase the unit for $500, it is refundable if you do not receive a unit or there is a delay in installation
  
Ofcourse, there are benefits of being part of this pilot. Participants will be among the first people in the United States to have a smart package mailbox, they will get a free Mailhaven replacement for life and will pay no monthly fee for the mailhaven for two years (Mailhaven is powered by 3G, therefore having monthly data charges). In addition, we will consider all feedback for pilot participants and will work hand in hand with their suggestions to design the next iteration of the Mailhaven unit.

If you are interested in participating in the pilot or learning more about what we are doing at Mailhaven, sign up for updates [here](https://mailhaven.co/contact/).
